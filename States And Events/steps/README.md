#STATE:
A state is a data that component can hold overtime and it can be called as the memory of a component.

#State variable -- A single variable in a component(component state).

#When one single component is rendered it is called as a View.

#Mechanics of STATE in React --
Do not do direct DOM manipulation as the react supports virtual DOM or rendering that entire component i.e. reacts calls the component function again

#React is declarative
#State is preserved throughout the re-rendering until the component is completly removed from the UI.
