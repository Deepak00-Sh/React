#Splittin UI into Components
1. Breaking up the large Components into smaller
2. Large may need too many props
3. Hard to use
4. LArge Components hard to understand and complex code.



##Small Components
1. We end up with 100s of mini Components
2. confusinhg codebase
3. Too abstracted

## So the components must be of medium size
-- Logical Sepration of content/layout
-- Reusability
-- Responsibilities/complexity

** Never declare a new component inside another component
